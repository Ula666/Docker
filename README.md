# Docker
- is a containerisation platform
- can work with any OS
- creates containers and networks
- docker is faster than VM and smaller in size, and easily integrated in any system
- Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

### Advantages:
- self-healing (checks if the containers are "healthy", if not it destroys them and create a new one. 
- load balancing
- auto scaling

### What is containerization?
- Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely.
-  It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure.

### What is Kubernetes?
- Kubernetes — also known as “k8s” or “kube” — is a container orchestration platform for scheduling and automating the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.
- Benefits:
- **Multi-cloud capability**-can host workloads running on a single cloud as well as workloads that are spread across multiple clouds, and can easily scale its environment from one cloud to another.
- **Self-monitoring**-Kubernetes checks constantly the health of nodes and containers
- **Automates various manual processes**-for instance, Kubernetes will control for you which server will host the container, how it will be launched etc
- **Interacts with several groups of containers**-Kubernetes is able to manage more cluster at the same time

### Microservices
- Microservices are a popular software design architecture that breaks apart monolithic systems. Applications are built as collections of loosely coupled services. Each microservice is responsible for a single feature. They interact with each other through communication protocols such as HTTP and TCP.
- prinicples of microservices: 
- Service abstraction (services hide their internal logic)
- Service reusability (service structure is planned according to the DRY principle)
- Service autonomy (services internally control their own logic)
- Service composability (services can be used together)

### Why use containers?
- Containers offer all the benefits of VMs, including application isolation, cost-effective scalability, and disposability. But the additional layer of abstraction (at the OS level) offers important additional advantages:
- **Lighter weight:** Unlike VMs, containers don’t carry the payload of an entire OS instance—they include only the OS processes and dependencies necessary to execute the code.
- **Greater resource efficiency:** With containers, you can run several times as many copies of an application on the same hardware as you can using VMs. This can reduce your cloud spending.
- **Improved developer productivity:** Compared to VMs, containers are faster and easier to deploy, provision, and restart. This makes them ideal for use in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and a better fit for development teams adopting Agile and DevOps practices.


### DockerFile
- Every Docker container starts with a simple text file containing instructions for how to build the Docker container image. DockerFile automates the process of Docker image creation. It’s essentially a list of commands that Docker Engine will run in order to assemble the image.

### Docker images
- Docker images contain executable application source code as well as all the tools, libraries, and dependencies that the application code needs to run as a container. When you run the Docker image, it becomes one instance (or multiple instances) of the container.

### Docker Container:
- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

### Docker instalation:
- Download the installer from official docker website and run it (you'll have to restart you pc after this step)
- Open git bash as admin
- use command `docker --version` to check if docker is installed 
- run a tes command to see if docker is working properly: `docker run hello-world` 



### commands:
- `docker --version`
- `docker run hello-world` to run the docker image/ download if its not there
- `docker rmi hello-world -f` to delete the image (f to force delete it)
- `docker rm 099ab08595a0 -f ` to delete container using container id
- `docker images` to check what images we have
- `docker pull hello-world` to check the image, see if we have it/it exist and not run it yet
- `docker ps -a` to check running containers
- `docker run -d -p 2368:2368 ghost` to create a container
- `http://localhost:2368/` copy that to a web browser and check if its running
- `docker run -d -p 88:80 nginx`
- `docker exec -it 2989b796a287 sh` to go inisde the shelll inside container
- `cd usr ` , `cd share`, `cd nginx`, `cd html`, `ls` to edit our html file
- `nano index.html`
- `docker cp index.html 2989b796a287:/usr/share/nginx/html` to copy index.html file to container and change old index.html
- to create a image:
- `docker commit <container_id_or_name> <username_on_dockerhub>/<repo_name>:<tag>`
- example: `docker commit 2989b796a287 rrose666/eng84:latest`
- then to push: `docker push <repo_name>`
- `docker push rrose666/eng84`

### Automate the build steps of our nginx customized image by using Dockerfile with set of instructions
- Naming convention to create Dockerfile is `Dockerfile` 
- `docker build -t rrose666/eng84` to build
- `docker run -d -p 8-:80 rrose666/eng84`  add ports to this 
- `docker run -d -p 4000:4000 docs/docker.github.io` command to download and access the oficial documentation, make it locally available on port 4000

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx
# here we using nginx official as our base image

LABEL MAINTAINER = ula@spartaglobal.com
# using label is a good practice, but optional

COPY app1 /usr/share/nginx/html
# copying our app1 folder from our OS to default index.html location

EXPOSE 80
# EXPOSE is the keyword to use to expose the required port for the base image

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
# CMD will execute the command in this case as this is taken from the official image
```
